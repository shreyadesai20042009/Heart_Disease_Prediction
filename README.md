# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on key clinical features like age, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more. It uses a machine learning model (like Logistic Regression or Random Forest) trained on a labeled dataset to classify patients into risk categories.
